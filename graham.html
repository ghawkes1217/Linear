Graham Hawkes is the founder and content and tech lead at Project Intuition. He received a PhD in mathematics 
from the University of California in Davis
in 2019.  After graduating he moved to Germany to become a post-doctorate researcher at
the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics in Bonn.  Afterwards he took a temporary position 
at Ben Gurion University of the Negev in Israel, before returning to the United States.  He
 currently works for Purdue Global University, an online university specializing 
in using technology to improve access to higher education for working adults, military personel and 
others with busy schedules and/or remote locations.
</p>

<p>He has taught courses in linear algebra, number theory, combinatorics, and statistics at
the undergraduate and graduate levels both in person and online. He is published in many 
of the top journals in his research field of combinatorics including <em>Algebraic Combinatorics</em>,
<em>Journal of Combinatorial Theory--Series A</em> (now <em>Combinatorial Theory</em>), <em>
Electronic Journal of Combinatorics</em>, <em>Contributions to Discrete Math</em>, and 
<em>Australasian Journal of Combinatorics</em>.
</p>

<p>
Throughout his academic career he has heavily relied on mathematical programming to analyze
data associated to open problems in combinatorics.  By looking for patterns in this data 
he is able to gain insight into the mathematical structures underlying the problems he works on.
In fact, his most recent paper actually utilizes a computer assisted proof!  
If he isn't writing javaScript code for Project Intuition or teaching courses for Purdue Global 
he is probably using Python to run data analyses on historical stock market data and tinkering 
with his automated trading bot.
</p>



<p>
He is driven by a passion for mathematics and a desire to share his appreciation
for the subject with creative and inspiring methods.
