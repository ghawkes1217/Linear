<p>Wencin Poh graduated from the University of California, Davis in 2021, specializing in algebraic combinatorics. He worked as an online K-12 math instructor at Mathnasium of Daly City, and recently joined effort with Graham to develop a product in education technology. He contributed mathematical packages for SageMath, a free and open source mathematics software system for researchers and educators.</p>
<p>Previously, he taught courses in calculus, linear algebra, abstract algebra, analysis and discrete mathematics at the undergraduate level both in person and remotely. He was also a summer course instructor for linear algebra and mathematical proof writing. Additionally, he was a Math Circle lead coordinator at Davis, organizing and coordinating learning activities and math competitions for students in grades 5 to 12. During his spare time, he would code in Python or develop board games with mathematically-informed mechanics.</p>
